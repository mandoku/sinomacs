;;; INSTALLING SINOMACS

;; In order to install Sinomacs, all you need to do are these three
;; steps (if you are looking at this file within Emacs, then you have
;; already done the first two):
;; 
;; 1) Make sure that the sinomacs.zip file is extracted somewhere on
;;    your hard drive.
;;
;; 2) Start Emacs, and open up this file.  From the "File" menu,
;;    choose "Open File ..." Then look for INSTALL.el in the folder
;;    you just extracted.
;;
;; 3) In the "Emacs-Lisp" menu above, select the command called
;;    "Evaluate Buffer".
;;
;; That's all there is to it.  From now on, Easymacs will start up
;; automatically whenever you run Emacs.
;;

;; This code simply creates or modifies an emacs configuration file in
;; the folder that Emacs regards as your Home folder.  If a
;; configuration file already exists, then it is modified to pre-pend a
;; line to it that looks like this:
;;
;; (load "path/to/sinomacs-folder/sinomacs.el")
